# This example workflow demonstrates how to use workflows to send custom
# email notifications.
#
# Workflows in the Civis Platform are written in YAML and a workflow DSL
# (domain specific language) called Mistral.
#
# See this website, https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html,
# for an introduction to YAML.
#
# See the Mistral documentation, https://docs.openstack.org/mistral/train/user/wf_lang_v2.html,
# for a description of the Mistral DSL.

version: '2.0'  # you always need this key to specify version 2 of the mistral DSL
