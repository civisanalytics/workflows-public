# This example workflow demonstrates how to run the same task for each item in a collection.
#
# Workflows in the Civis Platform are written in YAML and a workflow DSL
# (domain specific language) called Mistral.
#
# See this website, https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html,
# for an introduction to YAML.
#
# See the Mistral documentation, https://docs.openstack.org/mistral/train/user/wf_lang_v2.html,
# for a description of the Mistral DSL.
