# This example workflow demonstrates how to define & refer to YAML variables in workflows.
#
# Workflows in the Civis Platform are written in YAML and a workflow DSL
# (domain specific language) called Mistral.
#
# See this website, https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html,
# for an introduction to YAML.
#
# See the Mistral documentation, https://docs.openstack.org/mistral/pike/user/dsl_v2.html,
# for a description of the Mistral DSL.

version: '2.0'  # you always need this key to specify version 2 of the mistral DSL
workflow:
  input:
    # Before the value, prefix the variable name with &
    - city_name: &city_name Seattle

    # The variable name doesn't have to match the yaml name
    - state: &default_state WA

  # Variables can be multi-line using a pipe
  # but not as part of the input block
